# volkey

### How to use volkey
You'll need [Auto Hotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) in order to use the `volkey.ahk` file. Then just double click the `volkey.ahk` file to open it with AHK (or add that to autostart).  

Use `CTRL` + the `Volume Wheel` of your keyboard to change the volume of Spotify (preconfigured, see `volkey.ahk`). Use `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `Volume Wheel` of your keyboard to change the volume in larger steps.  

### Development
Use auto-py-to-exe to rebuild into the volkey directory.
